# Batched Addition

**Description:** Implements batched element-wise addition of two tensors. The kernel is pretty simple but at par with PyTorch's speed. This is a great kernel to get started with Triton. Adds two tensors with shape (B, N, T).

**Minimal Usage:**

```python
import torch
from vit.kernels import add

device='cuda'
dtype=torch.float16

batch_size=12
num_tokens=500
dim=200

A = torch.randn(batch_size, num_tokens, dim, dtype=dtype, device=device)
B = torch.randn(batch_size, num_tokens, dim, dtype=dtype, device=device)

y_torch = torch.add(A, B)
y_triton = add(A, B)
```

**Triton Version:** v2.3.0

**Other Notes:**<br/>
The kernel doesn't handle the broadcast addition as of now.

**Id in triton index:** 0011
